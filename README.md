Global Development Indicators Analysis (2000-2020)
Project Overview
This project analyzes global development indicators from 2000 to 2020 using a comprehensive dataset. The goal is to explore and visualize economic, social, and environmental metrics across countries and regions, providing insights into global development trends, resilience, and vulnerabilities.
Dataset
The dataset, Global_Development_Indicators_2000_2020.csv, contains 47 columns including:

Key Features: year, country_code, country_name, region, income_group, gdp_usd, population, gdp_per_capita, inflation_rate, human_development_index, climate_vulnerability_index, digital_readiness_score, governance_quality_index, global_resilience_score, global_development_resilience_index, and more.
Scope: Covers data for multiple countries and regions from 2000 to 2020.
Source: Not specified in the notebook, but assumed to be a publicly available or curated dataset for development analysis.

Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in global development metrics.
Visualize key indicators such as GDP, population, human development, and climate vulnerability.
Identify correlations and patterns across economic, social, and environmental factors.
Provide insights into global resilience and development disparities.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

You can install them using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Project Structure

Global_Dev_Indicator_project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis code.
Global_Development_Indicators_2000_2020.csv: Dataset used for analysis (ensure it is placed in the correct directory).
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

How to Run

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-development-indicators.git
cd global-development-indicators


Set Up the Environment:Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and install the required libraries (see Prerequisites).

Prepare the Dataset:Place the Global_Development_Indicators_2000_2020.csv file in the project directory or update the file path in the notebook to match your setup (e.g., replace /content/drive/MyDrive/Data analysis projects/ with your local path).

Run the Notebook:Open Global_Dev_Indicator_project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
jupyter notebook Global_Dev_Indicator_project.ipynb

Execute the cells to load the dataset and perform the analysis.


Current Implementation
The notebook currently includes:

Data Loading: Imports the dataset using pandas and displays the first five rows.
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Future Steps: The notebook is in progress, with empty cells indicating planned analyses, such as visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlations.

Planned Enhancements

Generate visualizations (e.g., line plots, heatmaps) for key indicators like GDP per capita and human development index over time.
Conduct statistical analysis to explore relationships between variables (e.g., GDP vs. climate vulnerability).
Filter data by region or income group for comparative analysis.
Add documentation for specific analyses and findings.
